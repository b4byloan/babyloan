              Say it/Itte is about a girl in the MV who has recently lost someone and you can infer that they told her that they were going to commit suicide and while at the time she doesn't think much of it while after a while she wishes they said it more clearly hence the title say it. What i do like about it is the representation in the MV (Music video) of her looking over high places such as tall buildings , ledges almost questioning why would anyone do such a thing and jump. You can also see her guilt and fear symbolised as a black shadowed creature almost following her around. Her carefree attitude at the beginning (Look, about that thing you said ,I didn’t feel like thinking about it too much, So I had forgotten about ) can also be interpreted as self loathing because while at the beginning it seems she doesn't care as it progresses you can see that she truly see how she blames herself and at times alternates between accepting the fact that her love is dead and denying that she's dead. Each use of the phrase say it links to a different mean;
