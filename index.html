            If you've been following whatever's been popular within Japanese music, you probably know who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRIgIJQWuBJ0Cv_VlU3USNA" title="Visit their channel" target="_blank">Yorushika (ヨルシカ)</a> is or have heard a song or two from them.
            Consisting of only two members in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-buna" target="_blank">n-buna</a> (former Vocaloid producer and now songwriter/guitarist for the duo) and <a href="https://hiroyuki-sawano.fandom.com/wiki/Suis" target="_blank">suis</a> (incredible female vocalist), the two were fans of each others' talents and ended up working together at a couple of n-buna's solo concerts. Eventually in 2017, the two officially got together and debuted as the music group called Yorushika. And it's no surprise that this band got a ton of attention in such a short amount of time; the way they mix upbeat/exciting-sounding music with more somber lyrics, as well as their ability to tell a story through a song/album, was something many people found to be enjoyable.

                Say it/Itte is about a girl in the MV who has recently lost someone and you can infer that they told her that they were going to commit suicide and while at the time she doesn't think much of it while after a while she wishes they said it more clearly hence the title say it. What i do like about it is the representation in the MV (Music video) of her looking over high places such as tall buildings , ledges almost questioning why would anyone do such a thing and jump. You can also see her guilt and fear symbolised as a black shadowed creature almost following her around. Her carefree attitude at the beginning (Look, about that thing you said ,I didn't feel like thinking about it too much, So I had forgotten about ) can also be interpreted as self loathing because while at the beginning it seems she doesn't care as it progresses you can see that she truly see how she blames herself and at times alternates between accepting the fact that her love is dead and denying that she's dead. Each use of the phrase say it links to a different mean;

                (“I'm looking at such a fine moon by myself”, though this is actually an error on the artist's part; the actual line is “I am here looking at such a fine moon by myself”)
                Here we are, the final song. This is another that's forever associated with A Whisker Away when it really shouldn't be. Usotsuki is, in short, a total gut punch. It's in the same vein of Yakou and Hana ni Bourei, though we'll see that it has its own distinctive theme. It's also yet another song inspired by Ozaki Housai, with the line quoted in the image above being pulled from him, as well as the imagery of drinking love with a ladle without its bottom. What you really have to know about this poet is that his work is mostly known for its deep sense of loneliness, and this song does it like no other.
                Even though this is the last track and quite a fantastic one, honestly I don't have much to say. It has nothing particularly new, and by now I think you should be able to read it by yourself and understand. I think it's a pretty clear cut song, once you understand the idea of it. The key is in the title, and the first line pulled from Ozaki Housai. It is lying, but particularly it's lying about loneliness. The other part is the process of forgetting his wife, essentially. But more on that later. Let's look at some lines.
              </p>
              <p class="lyrics">
                <span>I've always been drinking buckets full of moonlight</span>
                <span>It's really true, just like the night</span>
                <span>With a pale, transparent taste</span>
                <span>I'm drinking love in a ladle without its bottom</span>
                <span>It's really true, without even having a taste</span>
                <span>The more I drink the thirstier I get</span>
              </p>
              <p class="video-starter-description">
                Maybe it's a safe syllogism to say that to the Plagiarist 'moonlight' is like love itself, which is a rather tragic expression.
              	This song is full of the Plagiarist going back on his word, which is to demonstrate the theme of him being a liar. The repeated line of “even though it's fine to etc. etc.” indicates that though he should be fine with just taking things as they are, he still doesn't quite want to say goodbye. And yet, knowing that he has no choice but to, it leaves him unable to say anything; not even the goodbye that he truly needs.
