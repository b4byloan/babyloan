                Say it/Itte is about a girl in the MV who has recently lost someone and you can infer that they told her that they were going to commit suicide and while at the time she doesn't think much of it while after a while she wishes they said it more clearly hence the title say it. What i do like about it is the representation in the MV (Music video) of her looking over high places such as tall buildings , ledges almost questioning why would anyone do such a thing and jump. You can also see her guilt and fear symbolised as a black shadowed creature almost following her around. Her carefree attitude at the beginning (Look, about that thing you said ,I didn&#39;t feel like thinking about it too much, So I had forgotten about ) can also be interpreted as self loathing because while at the beginning it seems she doesn't care as it progresses you can see that she truly see how she blames herself and at times alternates between accepting the fact that her love is dead and denying that she's dead. Each use of the phrase say it links to a different mean;

                One more thing is the visual of her repeatedly descending down stairs. While at first it just looks like playful fun at second thought it could also symbolise her descent into depression, going further and further as the song goes on. Everything from the monotone pre-chorus and my personal favourite the last say it at

                  this part
                </a>
                where her face goes sad supports this.
              </span> 
              This also links to the complex relationship between Elma and Amy which i have yet to get into however the base overview of their relationship provides more context to the sadness as their relationship is truly deep.

                Conclusion:
              </span>
              <span>This is my of my old favourites and the first song to get me into yourushika hence why it is my first review. While it does strike a chord with most people, I personally don't relate to it as i do on other songs by yorushika, The feeling of guilt of someones suicide can truly be a detrimental feeling and this song lets you know that its normal to grief and feel guilty.

                  You see, I&#39;ve actually realized already
                  Look, about that thing you said

                  I didn&#39;t feel like thinking about it too much

                <span>
                  Living blindly, recklessly, delusionally
                  Impulsively, impatiently, negatively didn&#39;t do me any good

                <span>
                  I&#39;m sure that on the last day of my life, when I think of what&#39;s gone before
                  All of it, all of it will be unspeakably precious, but
